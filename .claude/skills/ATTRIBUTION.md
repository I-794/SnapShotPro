## taste-skill
- Source: https://github.com/Leonxlnx/taste-skill
- Author: leonxlnx
- License: MIT (see `LICENSE.taste-skill`)
- Version: 1.0.0 (commit 01d8504)
- Installed: 2026-06-17
- Skills: brandkit, output-skill (full-output-enforcement),
  redesign-skill (redesign-existing-projects), taste-skill (design-taste-frontend)
- Removed 2026-10-01 (overlapping, mostly React/Tailwind-oriented, gave conflicting style
  rules): brutalist-skill, gpt-tasteskill, image-to-code-skill, imagegen-frontend-mobile,
  imagegen-frontend-web, minimalist-skill, soft-skill, stitch-skill, taste-skill-v1.
  Two design skills are kept, for the marketing pages only (not the editor), expressed
  as vanilla HTML/CSS: `taste-skill` for building new pages (it built /merge/,
  /studio-intelligence/ and the changelog), `redesign-skill` for polishing existing ones.

These were vendored directly into `.claude/skills/` (rather than installed via the
Claude Code plugin marketplace) so they are version-controlled and available to all
sessions on this repo, including Claude Code on the web.
