# Ship a version

Releases in this repo are driven by `package.json` `version` (the single version source — it feeds the footer `{{VERSION}}` and the returning-user "what's new" toast). There is **no test runner and no linter** — `npm run build` is the only gate. The changelog is the static page `changelog/index.html`, not a `CHANGELOG.md`.

Ask for the target version and a one-line summary of what shipped if not already given.

## Steps

1. **Bump the version.** Edit `package.json` `version` to the new `X.Y.Z`. This is what drives the footer and the whats-new toast.

2. **Update the changelog page.** Add an entry to `changelog/index.html` for the new version (match the existing entry markup/structure already on the page). If this release should surface the returning-user toast, also check `src/features/whats-new.js`.

3. **Build; abort if red.** Run `npm run build`. If it fails, stop and report — do not commit a broken build.

4. **Commit.** Stage the changes and commit with message `release: vX.Y.Z`.
   - **PowerShell only:** use a single `-m` flag, never a heredoc (`@'...'@` leaves stray `@` chars in the message). Example:
     ```
     git commit -m "release: v27.0.0"
     ```
   - Append the standard co-author trailer line on its own line inside the `-m` string if commits in this repo carry one.

5. **Push to main.**
   ```
   git push origin main
   ```

## Notes
- Recent commits use Conventional-Commit subjects like `feat(v26): …`; the user asked for `release: <version>` for the ship flow specifically — honor that.
- Confirm the working tree only contains intended release changes before committing (`git status`).
